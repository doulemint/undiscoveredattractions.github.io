# San Francisco

In the heartlands of Northern California, San Francisco is a hotbed for innovation and commercialisation. Whilst it’s in the era of modernity, this county city has much to offer.
 
### Camera Obscura 
 
This little gem is on the far west of the city, close to outer Richmond on the pacific coast. Cameras Obscura have had an historical association to San Francisco and it involves projection of an image onto a viewing table via a viewpoint at the top of the building. This Camera Obscura slowly rotates its viewpoint and you can have a full 360° view in around six minutes.

### The Wave Organ
 
If you have five minutes to spare and you find yourself within the marina district of San Francisco, a trip to the Wave Organ is a must!
